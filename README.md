 # **Hurst Exponent, ADF and KPSS**  

This repository provides Python implementations for checking the stationarity and long-term memory of time series data using key statistical tests:  

- **Hurst Exponent** – Measures the long-term dependence of a time series, helping to identify mean-reverting, random walk, or trending behavior.  
- **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test** – Checks for stationarity by testing the presence of a unit root in the series.  
- **Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) Test** – Complements the ADF test by assessing whether a series is trend- or level-stationary.  

The repository includes explanations and practical examples.
